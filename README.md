## Protest as Protocol

This project is a quiet digital rebellion against default data exploitation.  
It flips the consent model: **my terms attach to my identifiers** (email, phone, handle).  
If you use my address, you’ve agreed to my terms — not the other way around.  
If you ignore them, that’s the point. We log the silence.

---

## How It Works
1. My terms are published here, in plain language and machine-readable form.  
2. When a company uses my identifier, they have implicitly accepted these terms.  
3. Refusal or silence is logged as evidence of the consent asymmetry.  
4. The protest “works” whether they engage or ignore.
